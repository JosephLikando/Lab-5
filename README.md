I added a Bootstrap navbar at the top so users can navigate around the site.

Used Bootstrap's grid system to split the page into two columns.

Also added a button and an alert using Bootstrap's built-in styles.

I didnâ€™t write any custom CSS, just used Bootstrap classes for everything.

Linked Bootstrap using a CDN link.

For the Tailwind part, I made a responsive card layout.

Each card has an image, a title, and a button.

I used Tailwind utility classes like bg-white, rounded, text-white, and md:grid-cols-2.

Tailwind was also connected using a CDN script.

The layout looks nice and works well on both mobile and desktop screens.
